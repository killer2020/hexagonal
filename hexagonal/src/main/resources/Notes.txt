My service is built

Not I am not supposed go inside it.

its same like mac mini is built and you are

building wire that connect to port and HP screen.
or port and external hard drive.

now while building you shouldnt be opening up your mac mini.

JpaTaskRepository or JpaTaskRepositoryAdapter
http://localhost:8080/h2-console

Adapter layer should be as this as possible

Ports are always interfaces
